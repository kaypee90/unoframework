# UNO Framework

UNO Framework is an experimental micro HTTP framework that utilizes Radix Tree for implementing basic routing functionality.

## Overview

UNO Framework aims to explore the feasibility and performance of using Radix Tree data structure for routing in a micro framework setting. By leveraging the efficiency of Radix Tree, UNO Framework aims to provide a lightweight and high-performance solution for handling HTTP requests and routing them to appropriate handlers.

## Features

- **Radix Tree Routing**: UNO Framework utilizes Radix Tree data structure for efficient routing of HTTP requests based on URL paths.
  
- **Basic Middleware Support**: UNO Framework supports basic middleware functionality for intercepting and processing HTTP requests before they are routed to handlers.

- **Minimalistic Design**: UNO Framework follows a minimalistic design philosophy, focusing on simplicity and performance without sacrificing functionality.
